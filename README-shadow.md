- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @bitsofcotton
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in mathematics, diet size of codes and so on.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning to diet size of codes, making two operand combination up to aleph_2, and inverse of two operand combination also bases aleph_2.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on -.

Since no one except first to mid 2018 (2019?) (lost data but there's 10~20 people I don't have relation before and after then ) contacts me in general publics,
if there's the people who say they contacts me, it's false. And this account has NO relation with any company and so on since before registration. 

(2021-2022 year gap, someone seems contacts me but it might be spam mail, so the contact had be ignored.)

There's much possibility to be watched by someone if we borrow hosting service space even we don't permit the permission on the Internet nor 
without logged to access_log, there's no choice from my experience with many of hosting services. 
Therefore, we publish our files also here.

A twitter account I had (around 2017-early 2020 (I don\'t have clear memory), after then, I don't have any relation on the account.) had to be deleted
because of wrong fingerprint on SSL certificate.

sites.google.com has something buggy on javascript nor someone mitms on line. So we have to delete sites.google.com/view/bitsofcotton site.
(Text cursor bug.) And they are archived into web drives because of no response from anyone .

I saw a brain outsourcing service via some social bookmark hot entries, I don't have any relation with them.

The e-mail account that I use often losts mail including account login confirmation. So it might be intercepted nor filtered by spam filter.
I had had another e-mail accounts on some of hosting service / free mail, but they also had a probability to filter emails even in VPS.
(iCloud mail customer support had had be intercepted on inquiry and they knows, so both provider mail and icloud mail had at least some non small number of times.)
And this is low probability but also my line account is (except the blocked persons they aggravate my woe.).

I saw a propaganda news topic, I don't have any relation with any of online salon nor so on.

I also saw a propaganda news topic which they had sell/buy some accounts on the some services, I don't have any transaction such of them.

I have a dinkey academic background, so it's very low probability but if there's some propaganda nor so on, it's not me.

I need the time to re-read the things I bought before ((the books and kindle from publishers and) the reports that google scholar finds.)

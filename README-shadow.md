(instead of /etc/spwd.db)

Since no one except first to mid 2018 (2019?) (lost data but there's 10~20 people I don't have relation before and after then ) contacts me in general publics,
if there's the people who say they contacts me, it's false. And this account has NO relation with any company and so on since before registration. 

(2021-2022 year gap, someone seems contacts me but it might be spam mail, so the contact had be ignored.)
(early 2024/05, someone sent spam mail to me, the mail including some of the scholar ship introduction, thank you if this is true, however, we cannot communicate with the sender because we cannot know the sender information by e-mail we received only, the mail had be ignored.)

There's much possibility to be watched by someone if we borrow hosting service space even we don't permit the permission on the Internet nor 
without logged to access_log, there's no choice from my experience with many of hosting services. 
Therefore, we publish our files also here.

A twitter(X) account I had (around 2017-early 2020 (I don\'t have clear memory), after then, I don't have any relation on the account.) had to be deleted
because of wrong fingerprint on SSL certificate. I don't have any of twitter(X) account since then.
I either don't have facebook account since before github registration.

Either, I and things concerned with this accounts doesn't have ANY money transaction, whatever anyone says.

sites.google.com has something buggy on javascript nor someone mitms on line. So we have to delete sites.google.com/view/bitsofcotton site.
(Text cursor bug.) And they are archived into web drives because of no response from anyone .

I saw a brain outsourcing service via some social bookmark hot entries, I don't have any relation with them.

The e-mail account that I use often losts mail including account login confirmation. So it might be intercepted nor filtered by spam filter.
I had had another e-mail accounts on some of hosting service / free mail, but they also had a probability to filter emails even in VPS.
(iCloud mail customer support had had be intercepted on inquiry and they knows, so both provider mail and icloud mail had at least some non small number of times.)
And this is <strike>low</strike> middle probability but also my line account is (except the blocked person they aggravate my woe.).

I saw a propaganda news topic, I don't have any relation with any of online salon nor so on.

I also saw a propaganda news topic which they had sell/buy some accounts on the some services, I don't have any transaction such of them.

I have a dinkey academic background, so it's very low probability but if there's some propaganda nor so on, it's not me.

I saw a propaganda topic on some of the note.com accounts, I don't have ANY note.com account since before this account registration.

I either don't have any qiita account now and before.

I don't have any relation with any competitive programming concerns at least since we start to know them.

I need the time to re-read the things I bought before ((the books and kindle from publishers and) the reports that google scholar finds.)

My machine must be infected, even if we install with pursue near real time latest release with checking sign and hash on binary from CD-set I have.

My machine is infected.

NO ONE CONTACTS ME IN REAL AND INTERNET SINCE BEFORE THIS ACCOUNT OPEN CONCERN WITH THESE REPOSITORIES AND DRIVES EXCEPT FOR SPAM MAILS. I'VE BEEN FOOLED BY THE QUIRKS. WHATEVER ANYONE SAYS, THIS IS TRUE. BYE INTERNET.

dEEPl eTOj (COULD ALSO jTOe) IS BEING ATTACKED TO CATCH MIS-UNDERSTANDING ON SOME OF THE TARGETTED(?) PERSON. EITHER, AMAZON A8 DOESN'T FIND SOME OF THE BOOKS THEY SHOULD APPEAR ON TIMELINE. BYE.

-&gt; There's trivial case condition division:

* (i) To keep our files local.
* * This cannot avoid low-level attacks like firmware implant nor compiler implant.
* * We can avoid misrepresentation by ever some of the evil groups except for low-level layer attacker.
* (ii) To keep our files on private repository.
* * This cannot avoid to view from some of the groups on the server administrator.
* (iii) To keep our files on public repository on some another places.
* * If there ever exists some evil groups, they seek as fast as some another
* * groups because they sticks. However, this also open minded selection but
* * no selection.
* (iv) To keep our files on public repository to continue same places.
* * Open minded selection but we cannot avoid some of the evil misrepresentation.
* * Others can seek us with some time-based values. This is only the selection
* * to keep us safe enough.
* (v) Slow/fast switch them.
* * Only the attacker need to near the administrator, there's no selection
* * because any of the organization has some of the attack surfaces.
* * So we're blind from organization theirselves, this is no selection.
* N.B. ever with so, there's some of the laundering attacks they can use.
* * To avoid them, we can only use some of the community but bothers them.
* * We only focus on implementing/investigating some of the metaphors.
* * If our trial is spoiled, there's no plenty of the space even
* * the space on hack/think without some of the community (especially
* * authority they (seldom but not the none) can spoil some type of the
* * persons.).

However, we continue on this repository until we find clear evidence of harassements either if ever exists.

Bang. Our whole computation and networking environment is under control from some of the existence we don't have any communication. So implementing what causes some cleaner binary of system/compiler is under their watching environment, so they can control our result and they can use whole our result to jam out us and some another visitor to our account.

Some series of the software supply chain also have the problem concern with trusting society.
Either, the hard tuning algorithm also have the observation trusting matter.
So once we start questioning everything, there's no end to it.

So the problem is, what level we need to obtain the result from computing.

A psnd -e, -d commands, even with 64-bit integer calculation without footer for some paddings, the result can slips, so our computer's CPU might be broken but this isn't Intel's.
Either, \@plt call on a.out output but not in .S output but first we met them.
Sometimes 32bit simple float output goes well when original CPU float test is going very bad case.
The prediction test once experienced theoretical \[-1,1\]-valued result got \|a\| &gt; 10 in R valued one.
etcetc... (and more.)
So our machine must be infected but hash check with signature on /usr/..., /bin, /sbin doesn't says corrupted nor no illegal hash value encountered.

We only trust internal-states resetted - combination,N,R,f, either our localizer itself only. In this condition, our action is locked without the situation reset whole internal states in every time before/after to calculation.
We might be recommended to use GuixSD or nixOS as a qemu host machine with trusted hard/firmware if whole of the source code is audited one with this situation, however the consumer line...

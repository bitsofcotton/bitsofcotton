Since no one except first to mid 2018 (lost data but there's 10~20 people I don't have relation before and after then ) contacts me in general publics,
if there's the people who say they contacts me, it's false. And this account has NO relation with any company and so on since before register.

There's much possibility to be watched by someone if we borrow hosting service space even we don't permit the permission on the Internet nor 
without logged to access_log, there's no choice from my experience with many of hosting services. 
Therefore, we publish our files also here.

A twitter account I had (around 2017-2020 (I don\'t have clear memory), after then, I don't have any relation on the account.) had to be deleted
because of wrong fingerprint on SSL certificate.

sites.google.com has something buggy on javascript nor someone mitms on line. So we have to delete sites.google.com/view/bitsofcotton site.
(Text cursor bug.) And they are archived into web drives because of no response from anyone .

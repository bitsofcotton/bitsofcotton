My machine might be infected in low level architecture, so some of the repository will be sand castle when attacked by the attacker who has the connection to the manifacture. Even if we implement virtual machines on the system, if the code is watched by the attacker nor some pipe/display is cracked, the integrity isn't supported in any which way because former one rewrites behavior, latter one rewrites all of i/o.

This doesn't directly mean all of the concept is spoiled, the concepts itself is valid if Occham's razor is valid in theoretically, in numerically on my machine without network connection with generated random (not generating random). Whether all of the concept is valid or not with Ockham's razor condition is obscure, so if there exists a pillar enough beat with Ockham's razor concept, our world also obscure.

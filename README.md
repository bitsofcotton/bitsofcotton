We believe Ockham's razor concept. So all the things to do is to reduce hypothesis condition on my machine nor on virtual machine. However, the modern baremetal firmwares nowadays are huge enough (from hypothesis), so we can only implement vm on syscall ones on baremetal mnemonics. Otherwise, it's equivalent from manufactures nor system distribution makers of vm.
